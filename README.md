# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 Crowdfunding ETL

It was a project on ETL Crowdfunding.

There are some advantages with ETL as all the data is centralized.
But there are disadvantages. Data comes from different resources and is prone to mistakes and missing data. 
It is hard to organize data without mistakes.

But once it's done, it is easy to manage.

It may be an overkill for data that can be collected in EXCEL file, but for big data ETL might be useful.
